CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:92 (add_executable):
  Policy CMP0037 is not set: Target names should not be reserved and should
  match a validity pattern.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0037" for policy
  details.  Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this
  warning.

  The target name "test" is reserved when CTest testing is enabled.  It may
  result in undefined behavior.
